## The final resting place of my plugin works in Rust

Hi, my name is Default. I've spent the better part of the last ~6 years of my life heavily involved with Rust.
From a small start getting into servers with a random dude I met on a random server, to eventually owning my own network of a multitude of servers. 
Some of my experience is as follows:

- Project lead for BPBlast
- Gamemaster and developer for Base Invaders, prior to the Rustoria buyout.
- Owner of Default Rust, the last bastion for keeping old Rust alive.

However, come February 2nd, 2021. I received a gameban from EAC in relation to Rust.
I was heavily taken a-back, as I had never even thought about cheating on Rust, and I will admit; I have cheated on other online PvP type games. Namely: Escape from Tarkov
I appealed the same day, and as of March 3d, 2021 I will remained banned for my duration as a PC master race member.
With this news, I decided to leave my Rust days behind, and with a heavy heart I promptly left the uMod developing community (though still active in the Discord from time to time) and decided to look abroad for other games/projects to take an interest to.

Now I'm sure, if you stumbled across this you're looking for what's inside, so without further ado:

## Contents

- A collection of all the plugins I have worked on, in their current state as they sit in my IDE folders. (Note: Plugins that were sent to me for private modifications that are either paid for, or meant to maintained to be private will not be included)


## Conclusion

All and all, I had a fun and amazing time with the uMod community I soon saw as a second family once I began talking to the other members. A experience I will truly remember, and miss.
I would like to personally thank a few members of said community for helping me along my journey, and teaching me a thing or two.

## A special thanks

 - FujiCura - Tought me many things that I would never have thought possible with plugins, and gave plenty of useful pointers for when I was stuck. I hope you're doing well dear friend, please come back. We all miss you.
 - redBDGR - My mentor, when I knew nothing and reached out for help you were there. Helped me through the learning experience of the creation of plugins.
 - Calytic - A truly amazing person I got the honor of truly knowing and connecting with towards the end. Always strong willed, and always has the best for the community in his mind when making decisions. As well as one of the main contributors to the uMod project. Amazing work, I can't wait to see where it goes.
 - Wulf - I know you and I never saw eye to eye, and I've had my fair share of fuck-ups, but you have taught me so many things that I could never explain on this readme file without it turning into another Stephen King book in terms of length. Just know that I, and the rest of the uMod team/community appreciate all the hard work you've done, and continue to do.
 - Whispers88 - Reaching out to me when I was feeling at my lowest. Making sure I was okay, as well as being a supportive person towards not only me, but plenty of others around him. Someone I truly look up to, and aspired to be one day. Just maybe without the procrastination.... All jokes, I swear!
 - Sylynt - The man who started it all. You're the one who got me into servers, got me into the inner workings of Rust. You're the one who sparked my flame, and gave me the fuel to let it grow, with our humble beginnings with Rusted Degenerates, all the way to the end. Thank you. The best friend, and teammate I have ever met online.
 




And with this, I wrap up. Thank you for stopping by. Take care!
